Why this demo exists:

If you're a neobank or card issuer trying to drive adoption of your card, this should help. Imagine you

1. Issue a virtual card

3. User clicks the button, the virtual card is now saved in chrome/safari
4. (Days later) User is shopping on target.com, browser offers cash card as an autofill
